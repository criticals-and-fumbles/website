  Bulk dossier import template — Criticals & Fumbles Campaign Log

  Usage:
  - Duplicate the <dossier> block below for each session you're importing.
  - id            — becomes the dossier's code. Must be unique within its campaign.
  - campaignSlug  — must match an existing campaign of yours (the part of its
                    URL after the domain, e.g. "stonemount" for
                    campaigns.criticalsandfumbles.com/stonemount). A slug that
                    doesn't match one of YOUR campaigns fails that row, not the
                    whole import — see the console's import result message.
  - Every field below is optional except id and campaignSlug — delete
    elements you don't need, or leave them empty.
  - threatAssessment meter "level" should be one of: low, medium, high, very-high
    (the dossier page's meter bar only recognizes these four).
  - objective "priority" should be one of: primary, secondary, tertiary
  - objective "status" should be one of: open, done
  - Re-importing the same id + campaignSlug updates that dossier in place
    (createOrReplace) rather than creating a duplicate.
  - Media (images/audio/video) isn't part of this format — add those from
    the console's dossier editor after import, or directly in Sanity Studio.

 * Restructure Kit (cnf-website issue #26). Same conventions as

 * top-level keys `sections` (full-replace of the target world's own
 * world.sections) and `worldLevelEntries` (the same five sub-document
 * arrays, but not scoped to any worldUnit). See lib/wiki-import.js's
 * file-level comment for exactly how these are resolved — this is the
 * spec that parser implements, keep both in sync by hand.
 *
 * The actual per-world AI prompts (one each for Titan's Gate, Temasek
 * Tales, SingaporeZ, Shattered Tales — pre-loaded with that world's
 * current heading map and a voice-preservation note) are NOT
 * duplicated here; they're long, specific to content that lives in
 * Sanity rather than this repo, and already published at the Wiki
 * Restructure Kit link the console UI points to. This template is
 * generic across all four worlds — only the prompt differs per world.

export const WIKI_IMPORT_PROMPT = `You are converting my raw tabletop campaign notes into a structured JSON
file for a Wiki bulk-import tool. I'm giving you three things: this
prompt, the JSON template below, and my raw notes below that.

Rules — follow exactly, do not deviate:

1. Output ONLY valid JSON matching the template's structure. No markdown
   code fences, no commentary before or after, no explanations — just
   the JSON object, so I can paste your output directly into a file.

2. Keep the template's top-level keys: worldUnit, factions, keyFigures,
   magicItems, loreEntries, notablePlaces, sessionLogs. Delete the
   "_instructions" key from your output — it's guidance for you, not
   data to include.

3. Sort my notes into the right section by what they actually describe:
   an NPC → keyFigures, a group/organization → factions, a magic item →
   magicItems, background/history/culture writing → loreEntries, a
   location → notablePlaces, a session recap → sessionLogs. If something
   doesn't clearly fit any of those, put it as plain text/markdown in
   worldUnit.overview instead of forcing it into the wrong section.

4. worldUnit.name is required — it says which world unit within the
   selected world this import targets (creating it if it doesn't exist
   yet). For every other entry, only "name" (or "title" for loreEntries/
   sessionLogs) is required. Omit every other field you don't have real
   content for — do not invent placeholder values, do not write
   "unknown" or "TBD" into a field just to fill it in.

5. Enum fields must use EXACTLY one of the allowed values listed in the
   template's instructions (e.g. threatLevel must be exactly "friendly",
   "neutral", "cautious", "dangerous", or "deadly" — not a synonym, not
   a different case). If none of the allowed values fit, omit the field
   entirely rather than guessing.

6. If one entry references another (e.g. an item's current holder, a
   place's notable figures), and that other entry is ALSO in my notes,
   give both entries a short lowercase-hyphenated "id" and use that id
   to link them — do not invent a real database ID. If the reference is
   to something that already exists in the wiki (not in my notes), use
   its exact name as a plain string instead of an id.

7. Description/body/overview/lore fields are plain markdown text
   (paragraphs separated by a blank line) — not any special block
   format.

8. Never add a "world" field anywhere — which world this goes into is
   chosen separately when the file is uploaded, not in the file itself.
   Do set worldUnit.name (rule 4) — that part IS in the file.

9. If my notes contain something you're not confident how to categorize
   or which enum value fits, still include it — put it in worldUnit.overview
   with a short note, rather than dropping it or guessing.

Template:
<paste the downloaded template JSON here>

My notes:
<paste raw notes here>

/**
 * Resolves a Cloudflare Access-authenticated email to "their own"
 * teamMember document — without ever storing or querying by the plain
 * email itself. Both cnf-website and campaigns are PUBLIC repos, and the
 * shared Sanity dataset is publicly readable with no auth at all (see
 * teamMember schema's ownerEmailHash field description) — so the link
 * between a DM's login and their public bio can't be a plain email
 * field, or anyone can scrape it straight off the dataset.
 *
 * Instead: HMAC-SHA256(secret, normalized email) → ownerEmailHash. The
 * secret (env.DM_IDENTITY_HMAC_SECRET) lives only as a Worker secret —
 * never in either repo, never in the dataset. Without that secret, the
 * hash can't be reversed or even confirmed against a guessed email, so
 * the public dataset carries no recoverable trace of anyone's address.
 *
 * Linking a real DM's email to their document was originally a one-off
 * CLI action (scripts/link-team-member.js) — as of the admin panel
 * (routes/api-admin.js, gated on tier === "Horsemen", see lib/admin.js)
 * it can also be done through the console by an admin. Either path
 * computes the hash the same way and never stores the plain email.

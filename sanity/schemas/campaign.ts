/**
 * campaign — additive to the main criticalsandfumbles.com Sanity schema
 * (same project/dataset). One document per GM-run campaign; each of its
 * session dossiers references it via `dossier.campaign`.
 *
 * `worldRef` points at the main site's existing `world` document type
 * (confirmed against the actual registered schema — the original scaffold
 * spec's placeholder name "wikiWorld" doesn't exist in that schema, the
 * real type is `world`; see cnf-website/sanity/schemas/world.ts).
 *
 * campaign is read by cnf-website's public /campaigns pages WITHOUT an
 * auth token. NEVER create a `campaign` document with an explicit/custom
 * `_id` (e.g. "campaign.<slug>") from a script, migration, or raw API/
 * CLI call — Sanity's anonymous "published" perspective silently
 * excludes any document whose `_id` contains a dot. This already
 * happened once and required migrating 5 live campaigns off dotted ids
 * (see api-campaign.js's doc comment) — always let Sanity auto-generate
 * the id. See docs/lessons-learned.md and issue #32;
 * `scripts/audit-dotted-ids.mjs` checks for this periodically.
